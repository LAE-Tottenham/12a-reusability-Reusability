# Help! I'm trying to make this cool bot but my code is too messy :( Please help me organise it into reusable components.

# Define your reusable functions here:
#guess_gender, postcode_information,weather,get_cat_fact,message,weird_weather_bot
# Make sure each function only does ONE thing!!!!!!!!!!!

# After you have written the reusable functions, answer the following:
# Questions:
# 1. What are the preconditions for your code not to break?
#The user's answer to whether they want a cat fact or not should only be yes or no

# 2. Validate the user's input based on your preconditions.
#def yes_no():
        #answer = input("\nWould you like a cat fact while you wait? ").strip().lower()
        #if answer in ['yes', 'no']:
        #   return answer
        #else:
        #  print("Please enter yes or no ")

# 3. Why was it useful to use reusable components in this case? Please mention at least 2 reasons and don't forget to contextualise.
# It was useful to use reusable components as it was easier to understand the code as the functions, guess_gender, postcode_information,weather,get_cat_fact,message,weird_weather_bot all do different things
#Also, I was able to use the functions i created multiple times


# Further Tasks:
# 1. Put your functions in seperate appropriate files and import them in.
# 2. Make sure all of your functions (except the main one) only do ONE thing or process.
# 3. Add your own twist to the code.

# Extension:
# Add the following apis as reusable components and use them in your code:
